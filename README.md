# Adversarial ML Defense Tool

## Overview

**Adversarial ML Defense Tools** is a cutting-edge project aimed at developing tools to detect and defend against adversarial attacks on machine learning models. In the rapidly evolving field of AI and cybersecurity, adversarial attacks pose significant risks to model security, and this project leverages Rust's performance and safety features to build high-quality, secure solutions for real-world machine learning applications.

This repository provides a Rust-based detection tool that can be seamlessly integrated into Python-based ML projects, such as those using `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow`. The goal is to help machine learning engineers easily integrate security features into their models with minimal overhead.

## Features

- **Adversarial Attack Detection**: Detects adversarial inputs aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in machine learning models.
- **Model Robustness Enhancement**: It will provide defensive tools to make machine learning models more resilient to adversarial attacks.
- **Seamless Python Integration**: Designed to be imported as a Python module, just like any other `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow` utility.
- **Built with Rust**: Benefits from Rust's memory safety and performance, offering a reliable and fast solution to adversarial defense.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust**: For implementing the core detection and defense algorithms, ensuring speed and memory safety.
- **Python**: For easy integration with machine learning frameworks like `scikit-learn` and `tensorflow`.
- **PyO3**: To bridge Rust and Python, enabling the creation of Python bindings for Rust code.
- **Setuptools**: To package the Rust code into a Python module and make it easy to install and distribute.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data in Python during model training and testing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Rust**: You must have Rust installed on your system. You can install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Python**: Python 3.7+ is required to use the Python bindings.
- **Poetry**: (Optional) A Python dependency manager for simplified environment management.
